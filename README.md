# regret

The project brought back a lot of memories of me.

Regret always accompanies with everyone on the road of life. Every time you make a choice, you have something but also lose a lot.

I clearly know that I'm not a good coder, but I've really been proud and excited of creating these magic passwords.

Thanks for all the people and things I met, I owned and I missed.
